            <div id="bio">
                <p>I started my career at <i>web development</i> around 2010. During this time I aimed capacitating
                    myself in front-end development,
                    focus in <i>User Interface</i>, working directly with modular architecture in html,
                    componentization and <i>advanced CSS</i>, from animations
                    and <i>pixel perfect</i> to browser performance improvements.</p>
                <p>With time I’d been more and more involved with UI development and engaging fully with teams of <i>User
                        Experience</i>. Thereby I’ve
                    acquired a background knowledge in UX too, while participating in discussions about user
                    experience.</p>
                <p>I´m constantly seeking to improve my knowledge and getting to know new people. I currently work as
                    <i>Design Operations Leader</i>, focusing entirely
                    in team leadership and product management. I am responsible for maintaining the focus and
                    productivity, as well as increasing in performance, developing and develivering
                    scalability of products through <i>Design Systems</i>.</p>
                <p>I act as bridge between the teams of <i>engineering</i> and <i>user experience</i>, for I ease the
                    communication of these two teams. As
                    well as I participate in daily decision of the UX team and technical feasibility for the
                    Engineering team.</p>
                <p>I contribute with the professional growth of each one in the team by doing the <i>One-on-One</i> and
                    <i>performance review</i>.
                    In general I'm responsible for connecting and also balancing three parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Company's vision, the culture and business strategies</li>
                    <li>Deliverables and team focus</li>
